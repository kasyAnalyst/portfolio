# Data Engineer Portfolio
Hey there! I'm Prosper Collins — a passionate and evolving **Data Engineer**.  
This portfolio is a growing collection of hands-on projects I've completed through self-learning, personal exploration, and real-world practice.  
Each project reflects my dedication to mastering core data engineering tools and concepts — from building pipelines to working with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.
Feel free to dive in and see what I’ve been building!
