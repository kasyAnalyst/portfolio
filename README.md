# Data Engineer Portfolio
Hey there! I'm Prosper Collins — a passionate and evolving **Data Engineer**.  
This portfolio is a growing collection of hands-on projects I've completed through self-learning, personal exploration, and real-world practice.  
Each project reflects my dedication to mastering core data engineering tools and concepts — from building pipelines to working with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.
Feel free to dive in and see what I’ve been building!

### [Incremental Change Data Capture Pipeline on AWS](https://github.com/kasyAnalyst/data-engineering-incremental-pipeline)
* Brief overview:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline designed for incremental processing of change data from an operational database. Leveraging AWS-native services, the pipeline captures real-time changes, transforms the data, and loads it into an analytics-ready Redshift data warehouse. This enables efficient, scalable, and near real-time data warehousing using CDC (Change Data Capture) patterns.

* Technologies used:
Python, AWS Glue, AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, AWS DMS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, VPC, AWS CloudFormation and AWS QuickSight.
* Final Results: [Dashboard With AWS Quiksight](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ls5qioUdlYjd_Z1LnyVEyHbSm9Laymit/view?usp=sharing)
